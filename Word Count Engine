Implement a document scanning function wordCountEngine, which receives a string document and returns a list of all unique words in it 
and their number of occurrences, sorted by the number of occurrences in a descending order. 
If two or more words have the same count, they should be sorted according to their order in the original sentence. 
Assume that all letters are in english alphabet. 
You function should be case-insensitive, so for instance, the words “Perfect” and “perfect” should be considered the same word.
The engine should strip out punctuation (even in the middle of a word) and use whitespaces to separate words.
Analyze the time and space complexities of your solution. Try to optimize for time while keeping a polynomial space complexity.

Examples:

input:  document = "Practice makes perfect. you'll only
                    get Perfect by practice. just practice!"

output: [ ["practice", "3"], ["perfect", "2"],
          ["makes", "1"], ["youll", "1"], ["only", "1"], 
          ["get", "1"], ["by", "1"], ["just", "1"] ]
          
          
Important: please convert the occurrence integers in the output list to strings (e.g. "3" instead of 3). 
We ask this because in compiled languages such as C#, Java, C++, C etc., it’s not straightforward 
to create mixed-type arrays (as it is, for instance, in scripted languages like JavaScript, Python, Ruby etc.). 
The expected output will simply be an array of string arrays.

Constraints:
[time limit] 5000ms
[input] string document
[output] array.array.string


                                                              Solution
def word_count_engine(document):

  s = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
  d = {}

  word = ""
  document += " "
  order = {}
  n = len(document)
  idx = 0
  for i in range(n):
    char = document[i].lower()
    if ord('a') <= ord(char) <= ord('z'):
      word += char #O(n)   ?!
    if char == " " and len(word) > 0:
      if word in d:
        d[word] += 1
      else:
        d[word] = 1
        order[word] = idx
        idx += 1
      word = ""

  arr = list(d.items())
  res = sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (-x[1], order[x[0]]))  #m * nlogn
  # m: max(length of a word inside d)
  return res

document = "Practice makes perfect. you'll only get Perfect by practice. just practice!"

print(word_count_engine(document))

#### The output here is slightly deviates from the actual. My code outputs Tupples while the problem requires to be list.
